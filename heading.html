    <h1>What is Lorem ipsum?</h1>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and type setting industry.</p>
    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>

    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its layout.</p>

    <b>This text is bold.</b> But this is not. <br>
    <em>This text is emphasized.</em>But this is not.<br>
    <p>This text is <u>mispled</u>. But this is not.<br>

    <p>
        <b>Hello</b>
        <u>World</u>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Hello <u>World</u></b>
        
    </p>
